// Let's define a word as a string consisting of lowercase English letters. A word is called interesting if it contains a substring satisfying the following criteria:

// this substring consists of the same letter (let's call it alpha) repeated n times;
// either the word starts with this substring OR the letter immediately before the substring is different from alpha;
// either the word ends with this substring OR the letter immediately after the substring is different from alpha.
// For example, if n = 3,

// words aaab, abbb, and cdddee are all interesting (substrings that make them interesting are shown in brackets: [aaa]b, a[bbb], c[ddd]ee);
// word cddee is NOT interesting because it does not contain a substring consisting of the same letter repeated 3 times;
// word aaaab is NOT interesting: the substring highlighted in a[aaa]b is preceded by the letter a, and the substring highlighted in [aaa]ab is followed by the letter a.
// Given a string text and an integer n, count the number of interesting words in text.

// Note: text consists of words separated by single spaces.
